# Overview

This is the GetFit! Mobile App that I am developing. This app receives user input about any workout that they have done and will return a diet recommendation based on that workout. With this project, I have been able to improve my understanding of classes, as well as introduce myself to the world of mobile app coding.

## Description

The GetFit! app uses a text box and a button to interact with the user. The user can input a certain workout routine and expect a dietary recommendation for the workout routine they completed.

## Purpose 
I developed this app because I wanted to learn more about Android studio, as well as learn more about mobile applications. I believe that mobile apps are a great way to learn more about both front-end and back-end development.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

I developed this app using Android Studio and the Kotlin programming language. I also used the App.Compat.Activity library which is a fundamental base class for activities. I also used Logcat logging to help with any debugging that needed to be done in the development of this project.
